  <h1>About</h1>
  <p> myHlist is a chrome extension that helps you organise your many nhentai doujinshi's and maximise your nutting experience without the need for logging in!</p>
  <p> This extension allows you to freely keep track of the pages your on, go to any doujinshi at anytime with pages set, along with (not so many)other features!</p>
  <h2>Note: This extension is currently in early development, there are most likely some bugs present. But for now here are a few things to be aware of:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tags are not yet avaliable to be searched in my list</li>
  <li>The "add current with tags author etc." button only works on the front page of the doujinshi</li>
  <li>I've tested the length capacity thoroughly, although I cannot garentee that you won't break the app with over 40 entries</li>
  <li>Im currently storing all data within the local storage of the popup's domain (I know its bad), I will change that later on but for now I'd suggest you have a copy of your codes in a notepad or somthn</li>
</ul>
